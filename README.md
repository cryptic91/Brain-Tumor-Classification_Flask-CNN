# Brain Tumor Classification
## Using Flask and Deep learning
You can easily down the full project through this link [Drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19So-CQaSp-jASc9bdsYAuKjYzhJIhtxo/view?usp=sharing).

All the images with 4 folders are too big to upload as files in Github, that's why the drive link is provided. 
#### `Download` -> `Extract` -> `Execute`
To execute, open `CMD` and run the `python app.py` command. The project will run. If you haven't installed Flask, install the flask `pip install flask` and other necessary libraries.
